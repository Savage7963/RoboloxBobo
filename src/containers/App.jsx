    // These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
    
    // constructor()
    // static getDerivedStateFromProps()

//     // componentDidMount()

//     Updating
//       An update can be caused by changes to props or   state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

//      static getDerivedStateFromProps()
//      shouldComponentUpdate()
//      render()
//      getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
//      componentDidUpdate()

// Unmounting
// This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

// componentWillUnmount()
