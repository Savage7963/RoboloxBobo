// State is simpily is description of your app AN OBJECT that describes your application the state which describe my application is robots and whatever is entered in search bar State is able to change abole to change the value of the search box the value of the input and we are able to change the robots it means what gets displayed you need to remember this rule 

//  Props are simily things that come out of state so a parent feeds state into a child component and as soon as the child component recives a state its a property that child can never change a property the parent just tells it what the state is the child recives it as robots
